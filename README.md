Use Git clone to download the project

Initially redirect to target folders, it is frontend, backend in different terminal

Terminal1 :cd frontend
Terminal2 :cd backend

Run the frontend with the command line: npm start
Run the backend with the command line: nodemon index.js

Got an Issue in Submodule, Please clone the project for backend from main branch and clone the project for frontend from master branch
